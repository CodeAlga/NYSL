            <p>
              To support young athletes living in Chicago's northside
              neighborhoods, who have an interest in learning and playing
              soccer, with opportunities to learn and practice skills related to
              the game of soccer, especially those skills related to team
              cooperation and good sportsmanship.

            <h3>Vision</h3>
            <p>
              The Northside Youth Soccer League aspires to develop strong,
              well-rounded, and mindful athletes through the building of
              character, self-discipline, and leadership.

            <h3>General Info</h3>
            <p>
              The Northside Youth Soccer League was established in 1996 to
              provide athletes residing in Chicago's northside neighborhood an
              environment to learn and play soccer. To be a member of NYSL, you
              must be between the ages of 4-12 and reside in a Chicago northside
              neighborhood. NYSL is run by a small, full-time staff, and relies
              on the generous volunteer time of parents and former league
              members.
